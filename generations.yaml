    description: "The Honda CR-Z was a unique hybrid sports compact that attempted to blend efficiency with driving enjoyment—marketed as the world's first hybrid sports car. Featuring distinctive wedge-shaped styling with a split-level rear glass hatch reminiscent of the Honda CRX from the 1980s, it was designed as a spiritual successor to that enthusiast favorite. Powered by a hybrid system combining a 1.5L i-VTEC four-cylinder engine with an electric motor (Honda's Integrated Motor Assist system), it produced 122 HP combined output. Uniquely for a hybrid at that time, it was available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior featured a driver-focused design with a futuristic digital instrument cluster that changed color based on driving mode and a two-seat-only configuration in North America, emphasizing its sports car aspirations. Three selectable driving modes—Sport, Normal, and Econ—altered throttle response, steering assist, and climate control operation. Production began in February 2010 in Japan."

    description: "The 2013 facelift brought significant powertrain improvements including a more powerful electric motor (up from 10 to 15 kW) and a new higher voltage (144V) 0.6 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, increasing combined output to 130 HP at 6,000 rpm (up from 121 HP) and torque to 140 lb-ft. The Plus Sport System (S+ button) became standard, allowing drivers to access electric boost acceleration for up to five seconds when the battery is above 30% charge and traveling over 18 mph. EPA fuel economy improved by 1 mpg in both city (for CVT) and highway (for manual). Manual transmission models received a larger clutch and new lower final drive ratio. Minor cosmetic changes accompanied the technical upgrades."
