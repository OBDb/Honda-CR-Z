    description: "The Honda CR-Z was a unique hybrid sports compact that attempted to blend efficiency with driving enjoyment—marketed as the world's first hybrid sports car. Featuring distinctive wedge-shaped styling with a split-level rear glass hatch reminiscent of the Honda CRX from the 1980s, it was designed as a spiritual successor to that enthusiast favorite. Powered by a hybrid system combining a 1.5L i-VTEC four-cylinder engine with an electric motor (Honda's Integrated Motor Assist system), it produced a modest 122 HP at launch, later increased to 130 HP in the 2013 refresh. Uniquely for a hybrid at that time, it was available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior featured a driver-focused design with a futuristic digital instrument cluster that changed color based on driving mode and a two-seat-only configuration, emphasizing its sports car aspirations rather than practicality. Three selectable driving modes—Sport, Normal, and Econ—altered throttle response, steering assist, and climate control operation to prioritize either performance or efficiency. Despite its sporting intentions, performance was modest with 0-60 mph times around 9 seconds, while fuel economy (35-39 mpg combined depending on transmission) was good but not exceptional compared to dedicated hybrids like the Prius. Sales were disappointingly low in most markets, as the CR-Z fell between segments—neither efficient enough for hybrid shoppers nor sporty enough for enthusiasts. Production ended in 2016 without a successor, marking the end of Honda's experiment with the sports hybrid concept until the arrival of the NSX supercar. Despite its commercial shortcomings, the CR-Z developed a cult following and represented an ambitious attempt to create a new vehicle category that was perhaps ahead of its time."
